	The origins of modern evolutionary thoery
Notes/excerpts:
It was fisher's landmark 1918 paper that demolished the barriers
between these two schools of thought [i.e. mendelians and biometrics]. 
He formally denostrated that the focal traits of biometricians-contnuously 
distributed phenotypes associated with complex traits-are entirely consistent
Mendel's laws. 
Wright's seminal work on threshold characters made significant contributions 
to our understanding of major genetic disorders that superficially appear to have
non-mendelian basis. He elegantly showed that the sudden appearance and disappearance
of major phenotypes is fully consistent with expectations for a dichotomous trait
with an underlying biochemical or cellular determinant have a multilocus basis.
